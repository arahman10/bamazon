# Bamazon

A simple CLI program which uses Node.js and mySQL. It displays all products that are listed in the database.

The customer selects which item they would like and the program checks if there is enough inventory for the item the customer wants. If there are enough items then it totals the cost, however, if there is not enough stock the customer is informed and allowed to make another selection.

Behind the scene, if there is enough inventory, the requested amount of items is deducted from the total amount of inventory in the database.
